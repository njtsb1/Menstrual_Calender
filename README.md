# Menstrual Calender

## Menstrual calendar — what it's for

A menstrual calendar is mainly used to track your cycle, predict menstruation and the fertile window, identify patterns or irregularities, and help plan health and daily activities. Using a calendar regularly improves self-care and makes conversations with healthcare professionals easier.

## What a menstrual calendar does

- Records the start and end dates of menstruation to calculate cycle length.
- Estimates the fertile window and ovulation, useful for those trying to conceive or using natural methods.
- Tracks symptoms such as cramps, flow, PMS, mood changes; can include basal body temperature and cervical mucus.
- Detects irregularities such as very short cycles, very long cycles, or unexpected bleeding, which may indicate the need for medical evaluation.
- Helps plan travel, events, exercise, and medication.

## How to use it in practice

- Note the first day of each period; this is the basis for calculating the cycle.
- Record daily symptoms: flow intensity, pain, mood, basal temperature if monitoring ovulation.
- Use reliable apps to automate calculations and receive reminders; many apps also show charts and trends.
- Review patterns every 3–6 months to notice changes and record useful information before medical appointments.

## Quick guide on what to record

- Dates: first and last day of menstruation.
- Symptoms: cramps, flow intensity, PMS, headache.
- Fertility signs: cervical mucus, basal body temperature.
- Medication and events: start of contraceptive, travel, intense stress.

## Risks and limitations

- Calendars do not replace medical tests: if there is very heavy bleeding, incapacitating pain, very irregular cycles, or absence of menstruation, see a healthcare professional.
- Natural methods have a margin of error for preventing pregnancy; consult a gynecologist if you need reliable contraception.
- Privacy: choose apps that respect your data and read their policies before recording sensitive information.

## When to see a doctor

- Very heavy or prolonged bleeding.
- Pain that prevents daily activities.
- Persistently very short cycles (under 21 days) or very long cycles (over 35 days).
- Absence of menstruation for several months without known pregnancy.

## Recommended next steps

- Start today by noting the first day of your last period.
- Choose an app or a notebook; if you prefer digital, try popular apps that calculate ovulation.
- If you notice anything unusual, schedule an appointment with a gynecologist and bring your calendar to the visit.
